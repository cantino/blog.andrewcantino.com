Inspired by [Mike Perham's RailsConf 2013 event list](http://www.mikeperham.com/2013/04/11/railsconf-2013-events/), and not seeing one yet for this year's [RailsConf](http://railsconf.com/), I decided to put one together.  Please send me a note on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tectonic) if you have a party or event to add!
