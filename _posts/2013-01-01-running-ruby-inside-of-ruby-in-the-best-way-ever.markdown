There are no good Ruby sandboxing options right now.  You can sort of use `$SAFE` levels and [taint checking](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/taint.html), you can sort of use [Shikashi](https://github.com/tario/shikashi), you can use the [secure gem](http://rubydoc.info/gems/secure) to run in a separate process, and you can, with much care, use chrooted and jailed virtual machines or [Linux containers](http://lxc.sourceforge.net/).  None of these options met my exacting standards, meaning they're not ridiculous.  Therefore, I'm introducingâ€¦

**RubyOnRuby**!

An unholy amalgam of therubyracer's V8 engine and emscripted-ruby to allow a truly sandboxed Ruby-on-Ruby environment.
