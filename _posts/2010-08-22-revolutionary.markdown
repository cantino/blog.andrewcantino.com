<p>Sometime in the late &#8217;80s I convinced my parents to get an external hard drive for our Mac Plus to augment our extravagant two floppy disk drives.  We got a 70MB drive for about $400, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%24400+(1998+US+dollars)">which is about $500 in today&#8217;s dollars</a>.  Now you can get <a href="http://slickdeals.net/forums/showthread.php?t=2190461">2TB for $100</a>, or 10TB for $500.  This is an increase of about 14 million percent in about 20 years!  Talk about technological change!  I have no doubt that this growth - that storage is now basically free - can enable incredible new technologies.  What can we do with this?</p>
